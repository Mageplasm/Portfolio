				    	<h1>Bio</h1>
				    	<p>My name is Jitesh Bhatia, and I am an aspiring software developer. However, I was not always

							set on this path. When I started school at the University of California - Davis, I wasn't sure what 

							career to pursue. Initially, I began by majoring in Economics. My classes involved market 

							analysis, studying income statements and balance sheets, among other things. I truly enjoyed it, 

							but my inner creativity felt bottled up. I wanted to see my ideas come to life, and Computer 

							Science has given me this freedom. My first programming course was in C, and I have continued

							to expand my programming repertoire with languages such as C++, Java and Javascript. My 

							progression along this path of learning software has helped me expand upon my inner 

							creativity, and allowed it to grow and expand to previously unreached levels. I hope that my 

							interest and dedication to software development will help me make a substantial positive 

							impact to the industry today.
